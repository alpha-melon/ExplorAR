## Daily process
* Morning standup starts at 10:30a
  * What we did yesterday 
  * What we will do today 
  * Obstacles? 
* Pair program on assigned tasks during the day. Worked on our own (on already prioritized tasks) at night (depending on our own stated capacity)
* At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
* Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each otherâ€™s code and merge into master

## Pull Requests
* NAMING CONVENTIONS:
  * Branch Names/ Git commit: RB to add link
* Approval of Pull request: 
  * Approval of Pulls done by at least one person in the other coding pair
  * Make sure listing and formatting is aligned across the team

## Team expectations
* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
* We will make sure that in any given week you are given both back end and front end tasks (a diverse set of challenges)
* We will rotate pairs after each feature is complete ( no more than two days per pair)
* Share the mic

## Communication Protocols
* Over communicate via slack channel 
* If you are changing at our agreed upon ticket/task in any way communicate to all 

## Issue Resolution
* If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  * Take 5 minute break
  * List out the pros / cons
  * Vote on it
  * If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
* If you are frustrated
  * Take a walk or get some water
  * Try again to resolve
  * Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
* We promise for hard conversations to try to document/whiteboard or visually resolve our discussions so that we have a record and way forward at the end
